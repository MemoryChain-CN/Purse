    /// - applicationSupport: For application-created support files. In general, this directory includes files that the app uses to run but that should remain hidden from the user. This directory can also include data files, configuration files, templates and modified versions of resources loaded from the app bundle. Files in this directory are automatically backed up by iCloud. To disable iCloud backup for a specific file, use the .doNotBackup(:in:) method.
    /// - caches: For data that can be downloaded again or regenerated, such as database cache files and downloadable content. Use for application-specific support files that you want to persist between launches of the application or during application updates. Note: iTunes removes such files during a full restoration of the device and that the system may delete this directory to free up disk space.
    /// - documents: For documents and data that is user-generated or that cannot be recreated by your application. Files in this directory are automatically backed up by iCloud. To disable iCloud backup for a specific file, use the .doNotBackup(:in:) function.
    /// - sharedContainer: For apps that share files on device with other apps from the same developer. The "app group" identifier string is used to locate the corresponding group's shared directory.
    /// - temporary: For data that is used only temporarily. Although these files are not backed up to iCloud, remember to delete such files when done with them so they do not continue to consume space on disk. The system will periodically purge these files when your app is not running.
